## Coding is awesome !

### I love coding because thanks to that I can create a lot of wonderful things !

With code, I can write awesome texts that I can broadcast to the whole world thanks to servers like FileZilla. I can write my text in _italic_, **bold**, **_italic bold_** and even in ~~strike~~ ! Great, isn't it ??

with code, I can also create amazing lists of item, just like this :
1. First item
2. Second item
3. sublist
